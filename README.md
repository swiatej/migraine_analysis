Migraine analysis project (model trained on personal data)

This project entailed gathering personal data, analysing it, and drawing conclusions from the results. I chose to work on trying to predict migraine occurences, while drawing on data such as step count, stress level, menstrual cycle phase among others.

The data used was acquired from three different apps, cleaned, and trained using AutoML. In the end, the model did not achieve good accuracy, due to the relatively small size of the dataset as well as the relative subjectivity of the variables.
